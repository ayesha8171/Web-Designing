sunflower, <i>(genus Helianthus),</i> genus of nearly 70 species of herbaceous plants of the aster family<i> (Asteraceae). </i>
Sunflowers are native primarily to North and South America, and some species are cultivated as ornamentals for their spectacular size and flower heads and for their edible seeds. The Jerusalem artichoke <i>(Helianthus tuberosus)</i> is cultivated for its edible underground tubers.

The common sunflower is valuable from an economic as well as from an ornamental point of view. The leaves are used as fodder, the flowers yield a yellow dye, and the seeds contain oil and are used for food. The sweet yellow oil obtained by compression of the seeds is considered equal to olive or almond oil for table use. Sunflower oil cake is used for stock and poultry feeding.
