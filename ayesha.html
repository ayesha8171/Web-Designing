<p style="color:blue">some gardens are for ornamental purposes only,While others also produce food crps, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes 
intermixed with the ornamentals plants.Food-producing gardens are distinguished from farms by their smaller scale, more laboe-intensive methods, and 
their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby or selg-sustenance rather than producing for sale, as in a market garden).flower gardens combine plants of different
heights,colors,textures,and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses.
