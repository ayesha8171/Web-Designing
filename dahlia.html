<p style="color:DarkMagenta">Scientific Name:<i>	Dahlia spp., Dahlia hortensis, Dahlia pinnata</i>.
Dahlia plants were originally a foraged food source and used as a water-carrying device thanks to their hollow stems. Today, they are primarily grown as a cut flower and used in weddings and bouquets. Dahlias symbolize resilience, wildness, positivity, and growth.
